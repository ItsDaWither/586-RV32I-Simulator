# Test Plan for OR Instruction

## Instruction: OR (OR Registers)

### Description
The OR (OR registers) instruction performs a bitwise OR operation between the value in register rs1 and the value in register rs2, and writes the result to register rd.

### Test Cases

1.  **Basic OR - Positive Operands:**
    -   **Purpose:** Verify basic OR operation with two positive register values.
    -   **Registers:** rs1 = 0x0000000F, rs2 = 0x00000003, rd = any
    -   **Expected Result:** rd = 0x0000000F (0xF | 0x3 = 0xF)

2.  **OR with One Zero Operand:**
    -   **Purpose:** Verify OR operation with one register value being zero.
    -   **Registers:** rs1 = 0xABCDEF01, rs2 = 0x00000000, rd = any
    -   **Expected Result:** rd = 0xABCDEF01 (x | 0 = x)

3.  **OR with Both Operands Zero:**
    -   **Purpose:** Verify OR operation when both source registers are zero.
    -   **Registers:** rs1 = 0x00000000, rs2 = 0x00000000, rd = any
    -   **Expected Result:** rd = 0x00000000 (0 | 0 = 0)

4.  **OR with All Ones in Both Registers:**
    -   **Purpose:** Verify OR operation with all bits set to 1 in both registers.
    -   **Registers:** rs1 = 0xFFFFFFFF, rs2 = 0xFFFFFFFF, rd = any
    -   **Expected Result:** rd = 0xFFFFFFFF (all bits are set to 1)

5.  **OR with Opposite Bits:**
    -   **Purpose:** Verify OR operation with opposite bits in the registers.
    -   **Registers:** rs1 = 0x55555555, rs2 = 0xAAAAAAAA, rd = any
    -   **Expected Result:** rd = 0xFFFFFFFF (all bits are set to 1)

6.  **OR with rs1 = rs2:**
    -   **Purpose:** Verify OR operation when rs1 and rs2 are the same value.
    -   **Registers:** rs1 = 0x12345678, rs2 = 0x12345678, rd = any
    -   **Expected Result:** rd = 0x12345678 (x | x = x)

7.  **Large register values:**
    -   **Purpose:** Verify OR operation with large register values.
    -   **Registers:** rs1 = 0xF0F0F0F0, rs2 = 0x0F0F0F0F, rd = any
    -   **Expected Result:** rd = 0xFFFFFFFF (0xF0F0F0F0 | 0x0F0F0F0F = 0xFFFFFFFF)
