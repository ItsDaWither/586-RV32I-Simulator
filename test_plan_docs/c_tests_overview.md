## C Tests Overview

The C code snippets in the `c_tests` directory are designed to verify the behavior of standard C constructs in the simulator.

### `arithmetic.c`
This test checks basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It initializes two variables, performs these operations, and stores the results in other variables.

### `conditional.c`
This test evaluates conditional statements using an `if-else` block. It compares two variables and assigns a value to a result variable based on the comparison.

### `functions.c`
This test verifies function calls and definitions. It defines a simple `add` function and calls it from the `main` function, passing two variables as arguments.

### `loop.c`
This test checks the functionality of `for` loops. It initializes a sum variable and iterates through a loop, adding the loop counter to the sum in each iteration.

### `memory_access.c`
This test assesses memory access operations using an array. It initializes an array, assigns values to its elements, and calculates the sum of two elements.
